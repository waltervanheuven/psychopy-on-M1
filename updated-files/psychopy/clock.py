Created on Tue Apr 23 11:28:32 2013

Provides the high resolution timebase used by psychopy, and defines some time
related utility Classes.

Moved functionality from core.py so a common code
base could be used in core.py and logging.py; vs. duplicating the getTime and
Clock logic.

# Select the timer to use as the psychopy high resolution time base. Selection
# is based on OS and Python version.
#
# Three requirements exist for the psychopy time base implementation:
#     A) The Python interpreter does not apply an offset to the times returned
#        based on when the timer module being used was loaded or when the
#        timer function first called was first called.
#     B) The timer implementation used must be monotonic and report elapsed
#        time between calls, 'not' system or CPU usage time.
#     C) The timer implementation must provide a resolution of 50 usec or
#        better.
#
# Given the above requirements, psychopy selects a timer implementation as
# follows:
#     1) On Windows, the Windows Query Performance Counter API is used using
#        ctypes access.
#     2) On other OS's, if the Python version being used is 2.6 or lower,
#        time.time is used. For Python 2.7 and above, the timeit.default_timer
#        function is used.
