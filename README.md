# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Installation instructions for [latest version of PsychoPy (2023.2.3)](v2023.2.3.md)

Latest version works natively on Apple Silicon Macs. However, vsync is not working properly on macOS Ventura/Sonoma. VSync works fine on macOS Monterey. There are also some other issues (e.g. Microphone and Eyetracker components are not yet working).
