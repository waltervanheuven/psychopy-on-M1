# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Instructions for PsychoPy version:

- [v2022.1.1 Qt6 version](v2022.1.1%20Qt6.md)
- [v2022.1.1](v2022.1.1.md)
- [v2021.2.3](v2021.2.3.md)

 PsychoPy [v2022.1.1 Qt6](v2022.1.1%20Qt6.md) works well, although there are remaining issues (e.g. Microphone and Eyetracker components are not yet working).
