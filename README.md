# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Instructions for PsychoPy version:

- [v2022.1.1](v2022.1.1.md)
- [v2021.2.3](v2021.2.3.md)

Version [v2022.1.1](v2022.1.1.md) seems to work! Audio, video, and ioHub works. Furthermore, `timeByFramesEx.py` reports no dropped frames. However, further testing is needed.
