# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Installation instructions for [latest version of PsychoPy (v2022.2.2)](v2022.2.2%20Qt6.md)

Latest version works well natively on Apple Silicon Macs, although there are remaining issues (e.g. Microphone and Eyetracker components are not yet working).
