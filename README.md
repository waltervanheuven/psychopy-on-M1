# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, and later) through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to run PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Instructions for [latest version of PsychoPy (2024.2.5)](v2024.2.5.md)

Latest version works natively on Apple Silicon Macs. However, vsync is not working properly on macOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia. VSync works fine on macOS Monterey. There are also some other issues (e.g. import PsychToolBox library error and Microphone components is not working).
