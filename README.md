# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Instructions for PsychoPy version:

- [v2022.1.1](v2022.1.1.md)
- [v2021.2.3](v2021.2.3.md)

Please note that [v2022.1.1](v2022.1.1.md) works. However, there are issues with sound and further testing is needed.
