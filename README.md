# Installing PsychoPy on Apple Silicon Macs

[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) runs currently on Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2. I've created instructions to install PsychoPy from source so that it runs natively on Apple Silicon.

Installation instructions for [latest version of PsychoPy (2025.1.1)](v2025.1.1.md)

Latest version works natively on Apple Silicon Macs. However, vsync is not working properly on macOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia. VSync works fine on macOS Monterey. Unfortunately, a number of components are not yet working because of issues with the Psychtoolbox library (Sound, VoiceKey, Microphone, Webcam).
